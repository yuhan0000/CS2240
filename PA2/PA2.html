      <p>The video above shows a simple yet extensive of Mattel Hotwheels' history that started in 1968.</p>

      <p>The first release of Mattel Hotwheels are as shown on the image above, better known as the "Sweet Sixteen". With the distinct look over their rival Matchbox, Hotwheels
          offered more vibrant colors and realistic and funky car designs which successfully enticed the youth back then. 
      </p>

      <p> For the first 10 years of production of the 1:64 scale cars, all its wheels have the distinct "redline" shown above. This was then used as a signifier
          that the hot wheels you might have right now is an old-first-gen castings. Values have been sckyrocketing since. At the time being, the wheels design and performance was
          unrivalled, having a wider and smooth base made the cars roll faster on the orange tracks. <br><br>After the 10th year of production Mattel has decided
          to discontinue the "Redline" wheels and create a new, better, faster, sturdier wheel.

      <p> Left- Treasure Hunt, Right- Basic Line.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Main Difference between the TH and Basic is the paint quality and the micro details of the casting, as well as the wheels are now rubber and the whole casting is
          made out of full metal (Basic Lines are metal but with plastic bottoms and plastic wheels).
