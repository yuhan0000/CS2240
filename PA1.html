        <h1> Evolution of the Internet </h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>The Origins of the Internet</h2>
        <p>The origins of the internet are rooted in the USA of the 1950s. The Cold War was at
            its height and huge tensions existed between North America and the Soviet Union.
            Both superpowers were in possession of deadly nuclear weapons, and people lived in
            fear of long-range surprise attacks. The US realised it needed a communications
            system that could not be affected by a Soviet nuclear attack.
            <br>
            <br>

            At this time, computers were large, expensive machines exclusively used by
            military scientists and university staff.</p>

        <h2>ARPANET</h2>
        <p> President Dwight D. Eisenhower formed the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
            in 1958, bringing together some of the best scientific minds in the country. Their
            aim was to help American military technology stay ahead of its enemies and prevent
            surprises, such as the launch of the satellite Sputnik 1, happening again. Among
            ARPA’s projects was a remit to test the feasibility of a large-scale computer network.Y </p>
    

        <p>Lawrence Roberts was responsible for developing computer networks at ARPA, working
            with scientist Leonard Kleinrock. Roberts was the first person to connect two
            computers. When the first packet-switching network was developed in 1969, Kleinrock
            successfully used it to send messages to another site, and the ARPA Network—or ARPANET—was born.</p>

        <p>Once ARPANET was up and running, it quickly expanded. By 1973, 30 academic, military and
            research institutions had joined the network, connecting locations including Hawaii, Norway and the UK. </p>

        <p> As ARPANET grew, a set of rules for handling data packets needed to be put in place.
            In 1974, computer scientists Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf invented a new method called
            transmission-control protocol, popularly known as TCP/IP, which essentially allowed
            computers to speak the same language.</p>

        <p>After the introduction of TCP/IP, ARPANET quickly grew to become a global interconnected network of networks, or ‘Internet’.
            <br>
            
            The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.</p>
